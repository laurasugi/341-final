		   <p>
		   	I was born and raised in northern California where my passion for art began as a young teenager.  In high school I attended a specialized program for the arts where I was studied classical observational drawing and painting. I began to experiment with many different mediums, focusing on graphite, acrylic and watercolor paint.  I was especially inspired by the human form and portriature.

		   	When I began college, I was a fine arts major and continued to focus on realistic portraiture and figure drawing. I completed associated degrees in fine arts and art history. In my final semester of community college I was working at a screenprinting shop and taking a printmaking class when my focus completely changed.  Printmaking allowed me to create art in a whole new way that fascinated and inspired me. It allowed me to create art that I could sell at reasonable prices to non "art people" while still being able to make a reasonable profit due to the reproducable nature of print-making.  This venture into new media eventually led me to the media arts.

		   	I visited Montana in 2015 for a friend's wedding, and during the three days that I was here completely fell in love with the state.  One month later I moved.  A year after that I enrolled in the university and am now pursuing a degree in the media arts program.
