# 1)Development Process
I spent quite a bit of time in development for this project, and think I did a fairly good job with pre-planning to help avoid issues
during the later stages.  Starting out, I made multiple wire frames and a site map in photoshop, which are included at the end of this
section. The wire frames were very helpful as I was able to place images exactly where I wanted them and see the effects before even 
beginning coding.  During the development phase I also did quite a bit of handwritten doccumentation, including a list of all image and 
file names that I kept right next to my computer while working.  This helped me significantly as I had issues in past projects with 
images or links not working because of small issues like capitilized letters that I wasted alot of time finding and fixing.  I also 
planned out my file organization and how I was going to organize my CSS.  
For this project I used multiple style sheets for each doccument which I have not done before.  I also did this due to past issues; many
of my css files in the past were too long and not organized and made it difficult to find and fix issues I was looking for.  This time
I made seperate sheets for specific effects and elements such as parallax, my navbar and forms.  This change saved me a lot of time and
helped me stay organized and avoid frusturation.
